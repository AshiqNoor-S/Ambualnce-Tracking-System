# LifeTrack
The lifetrack Project allows hospitals to track the location of ambulances and vitals of patients in real-time. The project sends the location and vital information of the patient to the hospital so that they can prepare to receive the patient and provide immediate medical assistance.


## How It Works
The project uses a combination of hardware and software to track the location of the ambulance and the vital signs of the patient. The ambulance is equipped with a GPS tracker and a device to monitor the vital signs of the patient, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This information is transmitted wirelessly to the hospital using SMS and also uploaded in the website at the same time.
The hospital receives the information and can use it to prepare for the arrival of the patient. The hospital can see the location of the ambulance on a map and estimate the time of arrival. Additionally, the hospital can see the vital signs of the patient and prepare to provide the necessary medical assistance upon arrival. The website can be used only after valid authentication.

## Installation
The Lifetrack Project is a web-based application, and it can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. There is no need to install any software on the client-side. However, the project requires the installation of the necessary hardware and software components on the ambulance and hospital side.

### Instructions
Clone it!
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Krypthon-Hackathon-VITC/Team-07.git
```
Go into the project directory and run the command:
```
$ npm install
```

After the packages and their dependencies are installed, run the command:
```
$ nodemon app.js
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and enjoy!

## Usage
To use this Project, hospitals must first register with the system. Once registered, the hospital can log in to the system and view the location of the ambulance and the vital signs of the patient. The hospital can also receive alerts when the ambulance is nearing the hospital.
The ambulance and patient tracking system can be used in emergency situations, where timely medical assistance can save lives. The project can also be used for routine medical transportation, where the hospital can track the location of the ambulance and ensure the safe transportation of the patient.

## Conclusion
The Ambulance and Patient Tracker Project is a valuable tool for hospitals to ensure the timely arrival and provision of medical assistance to patients. The project uses a combination of hardware and software to track the location of the ambulance and the vital signs of the patient, allowing hospitals to prepare for the arrival of the patient and provide immediate medical assistance.
